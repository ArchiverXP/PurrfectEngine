# PurrfectEngine
A Visual Novel engine coded in C++ with Lua as its scripting language!

# HOW TO COMPILE:

Get the dependencies (lua, sdl3, sdl3_image, sdl3_ttf and sdl3_mixer), and compile.

Makefile.pc: Linux (probably windows???)

Makefile.mac: macOS

Makefile: iOS (compile using theos)

DO NOTE that for iOS you need the required frameworks, you can compile them using a Mac.

iOS 6 building will require LegacySDL3.

Releases will be in the releases tab.
